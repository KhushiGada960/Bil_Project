# Covid 19 Prediction 


# Problem Statement 
Develop a model to predict the spread of COVID-19 in a given region based on the available data.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in an unprecedented way. Accurate and timely predictions about the spread of the virus can help governments and healthcare organizations to take proactive measures to control the spread and mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the spread of COVID-19 in a given region based on the available data. The model should take into account various factors such as population density, demographic information, and previous infection rates to make predictions about the future spread of the virus.
